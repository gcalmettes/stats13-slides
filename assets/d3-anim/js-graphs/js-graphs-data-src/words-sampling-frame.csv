0: Four,1: score,2: and,3: seven,4: years,5: ago,6: our,7: fathers,8: brought,9: forth
10: upon,11: this,12: continent,13: a,14: new,15: nation,16: conceived,17: in,18: liberty,19: and
20: dedicated,21: to,22: the,23: proposition,24: that,25: all,26: men,27: are,28: created,29: equal
30: Now,31: we,32: are,33: engaged,34: in,35: a,36: great,37: civil,38: war,39: testing
40: whether,41: that,42: nation,43: or,44: any,45: nation,46: so,47: conceived,48: and,49: so
50: dedicated,51: can,52: long,53: endure,54: We,55: are,56: met,57: on,58: a,59: great
60: battlefield,61: of,62: that,63: war,64: We,65: have,66: come,67: to,68: dedicate,69: a
70: portion,71: of,72: that,73: field,74: as,75: a,76: final,77: resting,78: place,79: for
80: those,81: who,82: here,83: gave,84: their,85: lives,86: that,87: that,88: nation,89: might
90: live,91: It,92: is,93: altogether,94: fitting,95: and,96: proper,97: that,98: we,99: should
100: do,101: this,102: But,103: in,104: a,105: larger,106: sense,107: we,108: cannot,109: dedicate
110: we,111: cannot,112: consecrate,113: we,114: cannot,115: hallow,116: this,117: ground,118: The,119: brave
120: men,121: living,122: and,123: dead,124: who,125: struggled,126: here,127: have,128: consecrated,129: it
130: far,131: above,132: our,133: poor,134: power,135: to,136: add,137: or,138: detract,139: The
140: world,141: will,142: little,143: note,144: nor,145: long,146: remember,147: what,148: we,149: say
150: here,151: but,152: it,153: can,154: never,155: forget,156: what,157: they,158: did,159: here
160: It,161: is,162: for,163: us,164: the,165: living,166: rather,167: to,168: be,169: dedicated
170: here,171: to,172: the,173: unfinished,174: work,175: which,176: they,177: who,178: fought,179: here
180: have,181: thus,182: far,183: so,184: nobly,185: advanced,186: It,187: is,188: rather,189: for
190: us,191: to,192: be,193: here,194: dedicated,195: to,196: the,197: great,198: task,199: remaining
200: before,201: us,202: that,203: from,204: these,205: honored,206: dead,207: we,208: take,209: increased
210: devotion,211: to,212: that,213: cause,214: for,215: which,216: they,217: gave,218: the,219: last
220: full,221: measure,222: of,223: devotion,224: that,225: we,226: here,227: highly,228: resolve,229: that
230: these,231: dead,232: shall,233: not,234: have,235: died,236: in,237: vain,238: that,239: this
240: nation,241: under,242: God,243: shall,244: have,245: a,246: new,247: birth,248: of,249: freedom
250: and,251: that,252: government,253: of,254: the,255: people,256: by,257: the,258: people,259: for
260: the,261: people,262: shall,263: not,264: perish,265: from,266: the,267: earth,-,-
