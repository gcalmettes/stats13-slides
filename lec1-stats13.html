  <h3>Motivation for this class</h3>
  <p class="quoted" style="font-size: 0.7em; margin-top:0;">
    What we teach is largely the technical machinery of numerical approximations based on the normal
    distribution and its many subsidiary cogs. 
    This machinery was once necessary, because 
    <span class="fragment highlight-yellow-gc"> the conceptually simpler alternative based on permutations was computationally beyond our reach</span> [...]
    <br>
    <br>
    Before computers statisticians had no choice. These days we have no excuse. 
    <span class="fragment highlight-bckg-blue">Randomization-based
    inference makes a direct connection between data production and the logic of inference</span> that
    deserves to be at the core of every introductory course.”

  <h3>How statistics solved the Cholera transmission problem</h3>
  <img class="plain" src="assets/img/lec/cholera-disposal-bodies.jpg" width="80%">
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      Cholera has been one of most virulent killers in history.
      <br>
      Millions succumbed to the 7 cholera pandemics since the first in 1817. 
      <br>
      It became the first truly global disease and also the most feared. 
      <br>
      Symptoms of this disease include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and a horribly violent case of diarrhea that can cause one to lose as much as 20 liters of fluid and electrolytes per day, leading to extremely severe dehydration.

      The first outbreak began in India early in the 19th century and spread to England in 1831 in the first of four 19th century epidemics occurring in 1831–1833, 1848–1850, 1853–1854, and 1866.
      <br>
      In part as a result of cholera’s mortality rate of between 20 and 25 percent, the nature of cholera—was it air or waterborne—and the means of its diffusion were subjects of intense professional debate.

    <p>Being skeptic, curious, not taking anything for granted is a good quality to have.</p>
    <p>
      The first cases of cholera in England were reported in 1831, about the time Dr. Snow as finishing up his medical studies at the age of eighteen. Between 1831 and 1854, tens of thousands of people in England died of cholera. Although Dr. Snow was deeply involved in experiments using a new technique, known as anesthesia, to deliver babies, he was also fascinated with researching his theory on how cholera spread.
      <br>
      In the middle 1800s, people didn’t have running water or modern toilets in their homes. They used town wells and communal pumps to get the water they used for drinking, cooking and washing.  Septic systems were primitive and most homes and businesses dumped untreated sewage and animal waste directly into the Thames River or into open pits called “cesspools”.  Water companies often bottled water from the Thames and delivered it to pubs, breweries and other businesses.
      <br>
      Dr. Snow believed sewage dumped into the river or into cesspools near town wells could contaminate the water supply, leading to a rapid spread of disease.
      <br>
      In August of 1854 Soho, a suburb of London, was hit hard by a terrible outbreak of cholera. Dr. Snows himself lived near Soho, and immediately went to work to prove his theory that contaminated water was the cause of the outbreak.

      By the middle of the 19th century, Soho had become an insanitary place of cow-sheds, animal droppings, slaughterhouses, grease-boiling dens and primitive, decaying sewers. And underneath the floorboards of the overcrowded cellars lurked something even worse -- a fetid sea of cesspits as old as the houses, and many of which had never been drained. It was only a matter of time before this hidden festering time-bomb exploded.
      <br>
      Soho was the neighborhood of John Snow.
      <br>
      First hand case study for him.
      <br>
      In Snow’s days, the science of public health and statistics, epidemiology, was not established.
      <br>
      He collected epidemiological evidence in a bid to convince other practitioners of his theory of cholera.

      1- We would record data on people. And define different level of music volume (high/low ... in this case CATEGORICAL) or (direct volume number ... in this case QUANTITATIVE). And we would observe the number of beer people would drink (Quantitative).
      <br>
      2- Women would be our observational unit. For each women, we would record if she was wearing red or not as a variable (categorical). Another variable would be the level of attractiveness felt by men (could just be "Attractive/Not attractive" or a value).
      <br>
      Lions attacks would be what we observe. For each lion attack we would store the time information (full moon or not).

      It is likely that the epidemic had a common source
      <br>
      To better see what was happening, snow placed the data on a map of Soho. Within 250 yards of the spot where Cambridge Street joins Broad Street there were upwards of 500 fatal attacks of cholera in 10 days.
      <br>
      He also added the water sources locations (blue points)
      <br>
      Deaths concentrated around Broad Street pump. Dr. Snow worked around the clock to track down information from hospital and public records on when the outbreak began and whether the victims drank water from the Broad Street pump. Snow suspected that those who lived or worked near the pump were the most likely to use the pump and thus, contract cholera.
      <br>
      But they are also data that are a bit different. Anomalies.
      <br>
      None of the workers at the Broad Street brewery had cholera: they were very close to Broad street pump.
      <br>
      Likewise the Poland Street Workhouse only recorded five deaths among its 535 inmates.

      Snow employed network analysis to calculate which water pump was closest to each house.
      <br>
      The stroke of genius: he based it on walking distance, not as-the-crow-flies distance.
      <br>
      He then used polygons to demarcate areas based on those findings. Because he added foot traffic to the equation, the output yielded a shape that clearly illustrated the relationship between human movement and disease.
      <br>
      It was impossible to deny the high concentration of fatalities in the population that was drinking Broad Street water. This map helped convince the local authorities that cholera was waterborne.

      London was without cholera from the latter part of 1849 to August 1853. <br>
      During this interval an important change had taken place in the water supply of several of the south districts of London. The Lambeth Company removed their water works in 1852 from opposite Hungerford Market to Thames Ditton [actually Seething Wells]; thus obtaining a supply of water quite free from the sewage of London.
      <br>
      The experiment, too, was on the grandest scale. No fewer than three hundred thousand people of both sexes, of every age and occupation, and of every rank and station, from gentlefolks down to the very poor, were divided into two groups without their choice, and, in most cases, without their knowledge; one group being supplied with water containing the sewage of London, and, amongst it, whatever might have come from the cholera patients, the other group having water quite free from such impurity.

      This was not a true experiment since Snow did not randomly allocated people into two groups, one exposed to contaminated water and the other not.
      <br>
      Clearly, this would have been unethical and certainly illegal. He did, however, recognize that allocation and near-randomization had taken place in a natural setting, and had taken advantage of this historical occurrence to test his hypothesis.

    <p>
      On the basis of these figures, which company is more likely to be transmitting "morbid matter" causing cholera? 
      <br>
      Cannot tell: Correct. Although there were more deaths in houses supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company, this could just be because this company supplied water to a greater number of people. In order to know whether one company is more likely to transmit contaminated water, we need to know, for each company, the number of deaths as a proportion of the number of people supplied with water.
      => Need to normalize to be able to directly compare data.
      <br>
      In order to estimate the denominator, Snow obtained information on the number of houses in London whose water was supplied by each of the two water companies.
      <br>
      Are there are problems with using a general total of houses supplied by each
      company as a denominator?
      <br> 
      - Ideally, the denominator should be all people supplied by water from each company, not houses. Different houses may contain different numbers of people. If, for example, the Lambeth company supplied an area where there were consistently more people per house than the area supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall company, then we might be misled by using the number of houses as a denominator. 
      <br>
      - Ideally, the denominator should be houses in the areas of mixed supply only, not all households supplied by the companies, because the patrons could differ substantially over the larger area.
